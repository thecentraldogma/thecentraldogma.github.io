- **Antibody**: A macro molecule, usually a protein, that is meant to bind to an antigen. The binding is enabled by a close match between the shape of the antigen and a complementary geometric 3D shape in the antibody. Antibodies are produced by the human body naturally (via B-cells, see below), but some drugs are also based on (externally created) antibodies. 

- **Antigen**: A general term for a foreign body that the body deems to be an invader that must be attacked / neutralized. Antigens can be macromolecules like proteins, or something else - for e.g. people with pollen allergies have immune systems that believe that pollen is an antigen that is then attacked. 

- **B cell**: A type of cell in the human immune system, that is produced in bone marrow. B cells are responsible for producing antibodies that are specific to the gemoetry of an antigen found by the immune system in the body. Each new B cell has about 10^5 copies of a specific type of random geometric antibody sticking out from its surface. This antibody is capable of sticking to antigens with certain geometries but not others. When a given B cell's antibodies bind to an antigen, this causes the B cell to divide an produce copies of itself: but two different types of copies are created -- namely, more B-cells with the same type of antibody sticking out on its surface, and B cells that are capable of secreting the same antibody. This is the process by which the body produces antibodies specific to a newly recognized antigen in the body, capable of binding to the antigen.    

- **BLAST**: 

- **Cancer**: A class of diseases with some common factors, in particular uncontrolled cell growth. 

- **Cell**: A basic unit of life. Discovered by Robert Hooke and Vanderleuven using a microsope in the 1600s. Human beings have about a million-billion cells, i.e. about 10^15 cells. The simplest life forms have a single cell, e.g. amoeba. Not all life forms have cells though  -- this gets messy because its hard to agree on a definition of 'life' -- for e.g. viruses. 

- **Central Dogma**: The idea that information flows in one direction: DNA --> RNA --> Proteins. First coined and proposed by Francis Crick in 1958. Several exceptions to the theory have sine been discovered. On particularly notable example is that of prions. Prions are infectious proteins which replicate without going through DNA or RNA intermediates. 

- **Differentiation**: The process by which the human immune system produces antibodies tailored to a specific antigen. 

- **DNA**: Deoxy Ribonucleic Acid is a very long sequence of nucleotide base-pairs (A, G, T, C) structured as a double helix. It is located inside the nucleus of the cell. 

- **Gene**: A section of DNA. DNA itself is a very long sequence of nucleotide base-pairs (A, G, T, C) structured as a double helix. A gene is a subsection of this sequence. The length of a gene is not fixed: there are short genes and long genes. Human DNA has between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. Genes encode information that produces proteins, which then perform most life functions and make up the physical structure of the body. Information from a given gene is 'transcribed' into mRNA by a molecule called the RNA Protease. This mRNA is a sequence of aminp acids, which then travels outside the nuclues, reaching the Ribosome, where it is then 'translated' by the ribosome into a protein. 

- **Gene expression**: The degree to which a gene in the DNA is turned on or off, thereby producing mRNA and thus proteins corresponding to it. A gene is turned on or off when certain specific molecules come and attach to the starting point of the gene, which either attracts or repels the RNA Polymerase enzyme to arrive at that point to begin transcribing the gene into mRNA. The gene expression level of genes is typically measured by measuring the amount of mRNA corresponding to each gene in a cell. In practice, we do not directly measure relative amounts of mRNA, but instead convert mRNA into the corresponding DNA fragements, via an enzyme called 'RNA reverse transcriptase', and then measure the relative abundance of the DNA fragments. The reason for this is that mRNA is fragile since it is single-stranded, compared to DNA which is double stranded. 

- **Gene-Gene Network**: a (directed) graph that encodes how genes influence one another's expression. 

- **Immunotherapy**: A class of treatments, where the drug makes the human immune system to do something that it isn't otherwise doing, and thereby achieves disruption of a disease pathway. An example is the immunotherapy drug Keytruda, developed by Merck, for certain types of cancer (via a long chain of acquisitions). The Keytruda molecule  works by targeting the PD-1 protein on the surface of immune cells. It blocks PD-1 from binding with PD-L1, a protein on cancer cells that deactivates immune responses. This blocking action enables the immune system to detect and attack cancer cells which was otherwise evaded by the cancer.  

- **Monoclonal Antibody (mAbs)**: are proteins made in a lab that can bind to specific targets in the body, such as antigens on cancer cells. They are a type of targeted drug therapy that mimic natural antibodies found in the blood. Each mAb is made to bind to only one antigen. An example is the immunotherapy drug Keytruda. They are called 'monoclonal' probably because they consist of a single type of antibody -- just like antibodies produced by all the clones of a single ancestor B-cell in the body. 

- **mRNA**: A single strand sequence of amino acids synthesized by the 'RNA polymerase' enzyme by using a gene (a section of DNA) as an instruction template. Each sequence of 3 nucleotides in the gene (called a 'codon') encodes a single amino acid (this is a many-to-one mapping since 4^3 = 64 possible codons, but only 20 posisble amino acids). 

- **mRNA vaccine**: A type of vaccine that delivers mRNA to the human body which then presents the mRNA to ribosomes in cells that then translate the mRNA into proteins. The vaccine effectively uses mRNA as a means to generate a desired protein in the body. The protein is typically an antigen in the disease pathway that the vaccine is pretecting against. The body therefore gets time to produce antibodies against this antigen, so if the body in infected by the disease, it already has antibodies that would neutralize the antigen. The COVID19 vaccine is an example of an mRNA vaccine. The 2023 Nobel Price in Medicine was awared to Kaitlin Kariko and Drew Weissman for creating mRNA vaccines. 

- **MSA**: Multiple Sequence Alignment. 
 
- **Protein** 	: a large molecule (macromolecule) consisting of a variable length chain of 20 possible amino acids. Typical chain size is about 350, but can be more than 1000. Proteins have many different functions, that depend on their shape. For example, Haemoglobin is a protein that has a specific shape that allows oxygen molecules to bind to it. Insulin is also a protein. Most receptors are proteins. 

- **QSAR**: 

- **Receptor**: 

- **Recombinant**: Recombinant refers to the technology used to create proteins by inserting the gene for the target protein into another organism, such as yeast or bacterial cells, which then produce the protein. This produced protein is used as the active ingredient in the vaccine to elicit an immune response without causing the disease, providing immunity against future infections.

- **Ribosome**: An 'organelle' in the cell outside the nucleus that does translation, i.e. conversion from mRNA to proteins. Ribosomes are protein-factories. 

- **RTS,S vaccine**: 

- **scRNA data**: Single Cell RNA data. This means that the data was collected from a single cell, rather than from a multi cellular organism. The data itself consists of the relative quantitives of various RNA molecules, which are proportional to the degree to which the corresponding gene that created that RNA, is expressed. The data is typically normalized for gene length -- basically, longer genes have a greater chance of producing RNA because the the 'transcription factors' (some kind of molecules) that must attach to the DNA have a greater chance of doing so for genes that are longer. 

- **SMILES**: A string representation of molecules, typically used for small molecules
