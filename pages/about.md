In early 2024, I realized I was drawn toward the upcoming field of AI driven Drug Design. I had felt drawn to healthcare for several years as a field to potentially have real tangible impact in. But AI + Drug Design is particuarly appealing because it presents an opportunity to create new medicines and save lives, while leveraging my skillset in machine learning. Convinced that I should find out more about this space, I began reading papers and books with the help of friends working in the domain. This blog is a catalog of what I'm learning, particualrly what is new to me from the biology/chemistry side.  

The [central dogma of biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) is the idea that information flows in only one direction, namely: DNA --> RNA --> Proteins. This was proposed by Francis Crick (of the Watson and Krick fame), and has since been shown to be not quite true.
