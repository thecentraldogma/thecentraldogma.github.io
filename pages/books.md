As someone with a background in machine learning but not in biology/chemistry, these are books that I've found useful so far. I haven't read them cover to cover, but I've found individual chapters / sections useful. It is also useful to ask ChatGPT (GPT4) for a basic explanation of a topic, along with references to a review article or book.

- **Medicinal Chemistry**, Patrick Graham. A large textbook that covers most topics related to drug design. 

- **Introduction to Protein Science**, Arthur Lesk. Anything to do with proteins. 

- **The Machinery of Life**, David Goodsell. A shorter book, written in more of a popular science style. 

- **Molecular Biology of the Cell**, Bruce Alberts. A very comprehensive textbook. I've used it only as a reference manual so far.
