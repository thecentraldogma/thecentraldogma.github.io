As someone with a background in machine learning but not in biology/chemistry, these are books that I've found useful so far. 

- Medicinal Chemistry, Patrick Graham. A large textbook that covers most topics related to drug design. 

- Introduction to Protein Science, Arthur Lesk. Anything to do with proteins. 

- The Machinery of Life, David Goodsell. A shorter book, written in more of a popular science style. 

- Molecular Biology of the Cell, Bruce Alberts. A very comprehensive textbook. I've used it only as a reference manual so far.
