For fun, this post is meant to capture the biggest surprises I come across in Biology (work in progress). 

- All **mitochondria** in human cells are descendants of only the mother's mitochondria. This is because the sperm's mitochondria resides in its tail, and when the sperm fertilizes the egg, the tail does not enter, only the head. 

- There are **diseases caused by the misfolding of proteins**. Certain misfolded proteins are called prions. These are infectious diseases, where one misfolded protein can cause other correctly folded variants to misfold. An example of such a disease is Mad Cow Disease. 

- The process of **information flowing from DNA** to mRNA (transcription) and then from mRNA to protein sysnthesis (translation) is absolutely astonishing when one first comes across it. All proteins are made this way. The process is highly systematic, and it is intiated by specialized biomolecules which either attract or inhibit the RNA polymerase molecule. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MfSYnItYvg) is a great video explaining this.

- Proteins are astonishing in their variety and function. Some proteins are literally like **tiny machines**, i.e. they do physical work, and use up energy. There is a protein that behaves like a motor pump, lodged in the cell membrance and rotating its head while picking up acid molecules from within the cell to expel them outside the cell so that the pH of the cell is mainained. I came across this in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm-3kovWpNQ) TEDx talk by Ken Dill.
