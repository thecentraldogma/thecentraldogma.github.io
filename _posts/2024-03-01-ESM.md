There have been a number of papers and models produced by the (now ex-) protein group at Meta's FAIR group. There are somewhat confusingly named in my opinion, with 'ESM' being a common part of several models. This short post is meant to simply list out the models and papers that come out of this group before they left meta to do their own startup. The github repo of all this work here still up here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm
