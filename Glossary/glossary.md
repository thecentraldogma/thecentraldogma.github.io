- Cancer: A class of diseases with some common factors. 

- Cell: A basic unit of life. Discovered by Robert Hooke and Vanderleuven using a microsope in the 1600s. Human beings have about a million-billion cells, i.e. about 10^15 cells. The simplest life forms have a single cell, e.g. amoeba. Not all life forms have cells though  -- this gets messy because its hard to agree on a definition of 'life' -- for e.g. viruses. 

- Central Dogma: The idea that information flows in one direction: DNA --> RNA --> Proteins. First coined and proposed by Francis Crick in 1958. We have since discovered several exceptions to the theory. On particularly notable example is that of prions. Prions are infectious proteins which replicate without going through DNA or RNA intermediates. 

- DNA: Deoxy Ribonucleic Acid is a very long sequence of nucleotide base-pairs (A, G, T, C) structured as a double helix. It is located inside the nucleus of the cell. 

- Gene: A section of DNA. DNA itself is a very long sequence of nucleotide base-pairs (A, G, T, C) structured as a double helix. A gene is a subsection of this sequence. The length of a gene is not fixed: there are short genes and long genes. Human DNA has between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. Genes encode information that produces proteins, which then perform most life functions and make up the physical structure of the body. Information from a given gene is 'transcribed' into mRNA by a molecule called the RNA Protease. This mRNA is a sequence of aminp acids, which then travels outside the nuclues, reaching the Ribosome, where it is then 'translated' by the ribosome into a protein. 

- Gene expression: 

- Gene-Gene Network: a (directed) graph that encodes how genes influence one another's expression. 

- mRNA: 

- mRNA vaccine: 

- Protein: a large molecule (macromolecule) consisting of a variable length chain of 20 possible amino acids. Typical chain size is about 350, but can be more than 1000. Proteins have many different functions, that depend on their shape. For example, Haemoglobin is a protein that has a specific shape that allows oxygen molecules to bind to it. Insulin is also a protein. Most receptors are proteins. 



- QSAR: 

- Receptor: 

- Recombinant: Recombinant refers to the technology used to create proteins by inserting the gene for the target protein into another organism, such as yeast or bacterial cells, which then produce the protein. This produced protein is used as the active ingredient in the vaccine to elicit an immune response without causing the disease, providing immunity against future infections.

- Ribosome: An 'organelle' in the cell outside the nucleus that does translation, i.e. conversion from mRNA to proteins. Ribosomes are protein-factories. 

- RTS,S vaccine: 

- scRNA data: Single Cell RNA data. This means that the data was collected from a single cell, rather than from a multi cellular organism. The data itself consists of the relative quantitives of various RNA molecules, which are proportional to the degree to which the corresponding gene that created that RNA, is expressed. The data is typically normalized for gene length -- basically, longer genes have a greater chance of producing RNA because the the 'transcription factors' (some kind of molecules) that must attach to the DNA have a greater chance of doing so for genes that are longer.
