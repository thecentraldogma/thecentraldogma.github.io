- 
- Protein: a large molecule (macromolecule) consisting of a variable length chain of 20 possible amino acids (some places say 25). Typical chain size is about 350, but can be more than 1000. Proteins have many different functions, that depend on their shape. For example, Haemoglobin is a protein that has a specific shape that allows oxygen molecules to bind to it. Insulin is also a protein. Most receptors are proteins.
