- What is the traditional drug discovery process and where can AI help? 
The traditional drug discovery process involves several steps: identifying a target associated with a disease, screening for potential compounds that interact with the target, optimizing these compounds for efficacy and safety, and then conducting preclinical and clinical trials. AI can assist at multiple points: it can help identify new targets by analyzing biological data, accelerate the screening of compounds through predictive modeling, optimize drug candidates by predicting pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, and enhance the design of clinical trials through patient stratification and outcome prediction.
