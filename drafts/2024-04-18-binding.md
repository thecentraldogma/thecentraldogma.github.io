Many bioloigical processes involve some kind of binding. This usually involves some form of geometric-specificity between the two molecules that are binding. Some examples are:  

- An antibody (either natually created by the body, or introduced by a drug) binds to an antigen (usually a foreign particle or molecule). 

- Insulin, a protein, binds to the insulin receptor, on the surface of cells, usually fat, liver or muscle cells. This sets into motion a complex chain of events that eventually results in glocose molecules in the bloodstrem being transported to insisde the cell.
