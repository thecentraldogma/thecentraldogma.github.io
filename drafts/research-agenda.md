New Directions to pursue

I am going to imagine that I am the PI of a lab or I'm at a drug design startup, and that I have a wet lab at my disposal. With the goal of drug design, and the toolkit of machine learning, there are a few areas I would like to devote time to: 

- Understanding disease mechanism for coming up with targets: are there targets that we can design proteins ligands/binders for that would throw a spanner in the works for the disease mechianism? This is a super important space because it provides leads for the next stage below. The question is how and where can ML help in this step? 
 - A traditional application of ML methods has been in genomics data, where 1 row of data is one person, the columns represent  genes and a label column represents whether the person has a particular disease. 
- Given a set of targets, designing proteins for it: conditional generation from diffusion models. 

** Modeling methodology **

- Foundational models for data that are not like text sequences: I think these is an opportunity to create an architecture that is better suited to single cell transcriptomics data. This data is not like a sequence of text, but the community has tried to shoehorn language modeling achitectures to suit this type of data, perhaps because it is quick and convenient.
