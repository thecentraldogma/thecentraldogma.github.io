I am going to imagine that I am the PI of a lab or I'm at a drug design startup, and that I have a wet lab at my disposal. With the goal of drug design, and the toolkit of machine learning, there are a few areas I would like to devote time to: 

- Understanding disease mechanism for coming up with targets: are there targets that we can design proteins ligands/binders for that would throw a spanner in the works for the disease mechianism? Where can ML help in this step? 

- Given a set of targets, designing proteins for it: conditional generation from diffusion models.
