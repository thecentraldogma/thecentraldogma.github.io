What exactly is personalized medicine? 

- Unlike machines or computers, humans are not identical copies from a single template/blueprint. We share a lot in common, yet we are different. It is well known that the DNA sequence of any two individual humans is not the same, even though it is very similar. 
- Many diseases involve genes, or proteins that are epxressed by genes.
