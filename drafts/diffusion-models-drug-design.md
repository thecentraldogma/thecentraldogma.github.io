This post assumed basic familiarity with the Variational Autoencoder, and is broken down into the following parts: 

-- How do diffusion models work in general? 
-- How are they used in generating images? 
-- How is conditional generation achieved? 
-- What is different when it comes to drug design? 
-- How are diffusion models used in drug design?
