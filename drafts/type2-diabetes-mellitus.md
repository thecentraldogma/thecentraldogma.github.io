In this post I will dive deep into the mechanism of type 2 diabetes Mellitus. This is an opportunity to understand a number of different processes in our bodies. As we will see, the list of characters is long: glucose, insulin, the pancreas, beta-cells, protein misfolding, islet cells, ER stress (ER = Endoplasmic Reticulum). Diabetes has a strong personal interest for me because 3 of my 4 grandparents had type2 diabetes, and because the south Asian genome has a higher than average predisposition to type 2 diabetes (henceforth T2DM). There exists a vast body of litereature on the micro biology of T2DM, but I am going to write it out in my own words here, so as to focus on the most important parts and to make it easier to read for an outsider to the field. 

I will focus on: 

- What does the normal metabolism of glucose in healthy individuals look like? 
- The genetic predisposition to T2DM: what is it? 
- What is insulin and how does it work? 
- What goes wrong in T2DM and why? 
- What is the mechanism of action of Metformin? 
- What is the mechanism of action of Ozempic? 
- The mechanism of how lifestyle choices like regular exercise help avoid T2DM?
- How does T2DM increase risk for cardivascular disease? 
- How does T2DM increase risk of artheroscelrosis? 

To begin, let us first describe the normal course of events in a healthy individual. Human diet conssits of 3 broad types of macronutrients: proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Carbs are chains of molecules belonging to a family that we will call the sugar family. The molecules in this family are Glucose, Fructose and Galactose. Simple carbs are those that are made up of just one or two molecules from this family (for example Sucrose or table sugar, is a molecule of glucose connected to a molecule of fructose). Complex carbs consist of much longer chains of sugar molecules. When carbs are digested in our body with the help of various enzymes, these chains of molecules are quickly broken down into their component molecules, which then enter the bloostream. Of the 3 types of molecules, glucose is meant to be absorbed into our cells for the purpose of generating energy, mediated via the ATP molecule. The transport of glucose from the blood stream, across cell membranes and into the cell is orchestrated by a special protein called Insulin. Insulin is expressed by a gene in specialized cells in the Pancreas organ, the so called beta-cells, when they detect that the glucose level in the bloodstream has become elevated. This gene is simply called the Insulin Gene. The insulin molecule, travelling in the bloodstream binds to the insulin receptor on the surface of cells -- primarily cells of the liver, muscle and ?. This binding event triggers a cascade of several intra-cellular events, which ultiumately causes a protein called the GLUT4 protein in the cell to move towards the cell membrance from the inside of the cell, ultimately lodging itself in the cell membrane. The GLUT4 protein has a shape that is specialized to allow Glucose molecules to enter the channel they have created in the cell membrane. In this way, the GLUT4 protein serves as a channeling protein, allowing glucose moecules to enter the cell. When the concentration of glucose molecules declines, the GLUT4 proteins dislodge from the membrane, and the insuin molecules also ubind from the receptors on the cell surface.
