How did protein structure prediction work in the pre-AlphaFold2 era? In this post I'll summarize the approach taken by a program called ROSETTA, created by the Baker Lab at UW. ROSETTA was the 2nd best team at CASP 14 where AlphaFold2 debuted, but there was a big gap between the performance of the two. The recent version of RosettaFold-all atom has all but closed this gap. Obviosuly, AlphaFold2 was a pivotal moment in the history of protein folding research, but it is still nstructive to know how folding was attempted, pre-alphafold2, at least at a high level.
