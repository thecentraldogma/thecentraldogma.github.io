- Protein tertiary structure prediction: given a protein sequence, predict its 3-dimensional folding structure in the native state. This is useful because 'structure determined function'

- Protein design: the reverse problem, i.e. given a (desired) protein structure, predict the protein sequence that has that structure. 

- Virtual screening: Given a small molecule chemical formula (or protein sequence), predict the properties that the physical molecule will have, i.e. properties like toxicity, solubility, etc. 

- Gene identification: Given a disease, identify the gene(s) that are involve in it.
